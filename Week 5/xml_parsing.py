
#Extracting Data from XML

#In this assignment you will write a Python program somewhat similar to http://www.py4e.com/code3/geoxml.py. The program will prompt for a URL, read the XML data from that URL using urllib and then parse and extract the comment counts from the XML data, compute the sum of the numbers in the file.

#We provide two files for this assignment. One is a sample file where we give you the sum for your testing and the other is the actual data you need to process for the assignment.

#Sample data: http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/comments_42.xml (Sum=2553)
#Actual data: http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/comments_589717.xml (Sum ends with 12)
#You do not need to save these files to your folder since your program will read the data directly from the URL. Note: Each student will have a distinct data url for the assignment - so only use your own data url for analysis.

#use pip install beautifulsoup4 requests lxml
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests

url = 'http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/comments_589717.xml'
response = requests.get(url)
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'lxml')
count = soup.find_all('count')
total =  sum(int(i.text) for i in count)
print(f'The sum of all count in doc are: {total}')
